          <p>I would like to travel to Japan for many reasons but the primary reason I would like to visit there is that, technologically, it is one of the most forward thinking societies in the world that is willing to embrace many technologies that the rest of the world has been slow to implement i.e. robotics and nano.</p>
          <p>I am also fascinated by its history, particularly with regards to world war 2 and it being the only country in the world to have been nuked.</p>
